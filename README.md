## Description

This is a command line application built to help you manage your items at your store. You can delete, update and add anything to your store such as tags, products, etc. Overall i struggeled little bit with the routes. But then relized what i did wrong and switched then all to async and its working good now.

## Installation

Follow these steps to launch the application
1. npm install
2. source the schema
3. npm run seed
4. npm start

## Usage

Hit the different end points. You can add, update, and delete any categories, tags, and prodcuts that you want. Just hit the end point with the json data you want to send and you can add or update. If you want to delete just send the delete request to the correct endpoint with the right ID.
